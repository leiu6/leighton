# Leighton Mitchell's Website

## Introduction

This is the Github repository for my own personal website. I will keep this repository public for the time being although I may take it private at some point.

This website will serve as my own personal portfolio and playspace. I will code the whole thing myself and upload the code here.

## Stack

The stack of my website consists of:

- HTML5 for the markup
- SCSS for the stylesheets
- Bootstrap for basic structure
- jQuery for dom manipulation

## Justification for Bootstrap and jQuery

I know that Bootstrap and especially jQuery have fallen out of vogue in more recent times. However, I am still choosing to use them for this project. The reason for this is that they are small components that do not force me into a certain paradigm.

With something like React, I would be forced into a very specific way of working. There is nothing inherently wrong with that, but for a small proejct like this, it just makes more sense to use smaller tools. I am also not very familiar with these front end frameworks since I am still fairly new in my web design journey. jQuery and Bootstrap allow me to be more hands-on while still avoiding all of the boilerplate that comes from pure JS/CSS.

## CSS Preprocessor

I am using SCSS on this project. I am not taking advantage of some of the more advanced features of SASS/SCSS like if statements and for loops, but I will be using the variables and the nesting to better organize my stylesheets.

## Conclusion

This website should be a good learning experience and hopefully at the end of this, I will have a working example that I can put on the web. I will have to find a good hosting provider. Depending on the future needs of this project, I might just take advantage of Github pages.

There are also many free tiers for hosting that I could use. Only time will tell.
